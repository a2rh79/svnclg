* ranges can now be separated by commas (e.g. range=1-30,31-60)
* versions can also be separated by commas and will be assigned to the
corresponding range e.g. range=1-30,31-60 version=1.0.0,1.0.1 would be
the same as range=1-30 version=1.0.0 range=31-60 version=1.0.1
* added .config file that stores the default path to svn.exe (only
needed when its not registered), a default repository path and the
escape character.
Log entries/lines beginning with the escape char will be ignored now.
* added parameter: range=... is the same as range=all
* added textwrap -> line/text width can be specified in the .config
file property textWidth (a value of -1 means nowrap)
* added textwidth/tw command
* added shorter commands: output -> o, range -> r, version -> v,
textwidth -> tw
* added option to specify version number with a *.
E.g. 1.1.* The * will then be automatically replaced by a 0 and will
be incremented by 1 with each given range, i.e. 1.1.0, 1.1.1, ...
or 1.1.5* The version number will be incremented by 1, starting with
the given number (in this case 5), i.e. 1.1.5, 1.1.6, ...
