* added textwrap -> line/text width can be specified in the .config
file property textWidth (a value of -1 means nowrap)
* added .config file that stores the default path to svn.exe (only
needed when its not registered), a default repository path and the
escape character.
Log entries/lines beginning with the escape char will be ignored now.
* added parameter: range=... is the same as range=all
* ranges can now be separated by commas (e.g. range=1-30,31-60)
* versions can also be separated by commas and will be assigned to the
corresponding range e.g. range=1-30,31-60 version=1.0.0,1.0.1 would be
the same as range=1-30 version=1.0.0 range=31-60 version=1.0.1
