Usage of the `range` command


= Details =
To specify a range of revisions the following parameters can be used:<br>
- `r=x-y` Where x is the start revision number an y the end revision number. E.g. ``r=1-50`<br>
- `r=all` or `r=...` All revisions/log entries will be merged to one ChangeLog entry

Multiple ranges can be sparated by commas:<br>
E.g. `r=1-50,51-100,...` This will generate 3 ChangeLog entries. The first for the revisions 1-50, the second for the revisions 51-100 and the third for all remaining revisions
